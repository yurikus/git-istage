# What is staging and why would I care?

If you just started with git, you probably have no concept of the *stage* (or as
some people confusingly call it *index*). In other version control systems, the
only thing you can select is which files you want to commit. However, git not
only allows you to do that but also which parts of a file you want to select.

Unfortunately, the built-in command line tooling for that (provided via
`git add -p`) is pretty hard to use and takes way too long.

## What git istage does

When you run `git istage` inside your repo, it shows you the set of current
changes, i.e. the output of `git diff`. But in contrast to `git diff`, you can
select individual lines and add them to the stage by hitting <kbd>S</kbd>. You
can also permanently remove changes from your working copy by hitting
<kbd>R</kbd> (be careful: there is no undo for that operation).

At any point you can view the staged changes (i.e. the output of
`git diff --cached`). If you decided that there are certain portions you don't
want to commit, you simply unstage the selected lines by hitting <kbd>U</kbd>.

All three shortcuts can be modified using <kbd>Shift</kbd>. In that case it will
apply to all consecutive changes, called a *block*.

In order to quickly navigated you can use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>, which
will jump between files, and <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd>, which will jump
from block to block.

You can also customize the way the changes are presented. By using <kbd>+</kbd>
and <kbd>-</kbd> to increase or decrease the number of contextual lines being
displayed. Alternatively, you can use <kbd>\\</kbd> to toggle between viewing
entire files or changes only.

When you are done, simply return to the command line by hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd>
or <kbd>Q</kbd>. Once there, I recommend you run `git stash -u -k`, which will
stash all changes you didn't stage so you can test the code you're about to
commit. Or, you can stash right from inside of git istage by hitting
<kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd>. Once satisfied, run `git commit` and unstash via
`git stash pop`.

A shortcut may be preceded by a number, N. 
Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.

## Custom Key Bindings

The [default key bindings](#keyboard-shortcuts) are set for a US QWERTY keyboard layout.

The key bindings can be modified by creating a JSON file at the following location:

- On Unix / macOS it's `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.git-istage/key-bindings.json`
    - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isn't set, it falls back to `$HOME/.config`
    - This follows the [XDG conventions](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
- On Windows it's `%APPDATA%\.git-istage\key-bindings.json`

If you want to get code-completion when editing the file, you should reference the schema:

```jsonc
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrajobst/git-istage/main/docs/keyBindings-schema.json",
    // ...
}
```

For instance, to use the <kbd>X</kbd> key to exit the program instead of the default <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Q</kbd> keys, use the following syntax:

```jsonc
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrajobst/git-istage/main/docs/keyBindings-schema.json",
    "Exit": {
        "keyBindings": ["X"]
    }
}
```

This will override the default keyboard shorts. If you want to add them, you need to list the ones you want to keep as well. For example, in order to preserve the default <kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd> key, you just include them in the list:

```jsonc
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrajobst/git-istage/main/docs/keyBindings-schema.json",
    "Exit": {
        "keyBindings": ["Escape", "Q", "X"]
    }
}
```

Please note that key binding strings are case insensitive. In order to differ by case, you need to prefix them with a `Shift` modifier, such as `Shift+X`.
